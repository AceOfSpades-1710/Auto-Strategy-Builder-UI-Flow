# Nubra.io Feature Proposal: Auto Strategy Builder

## Overview
This project proposes a feature to help manual traders transition into algorithmic trading on [Nubra.io](https://nubra.io).  
**Trade Replay & Auto-Script Generator** replays past trades, generates inferred strategies, allows visual refinement, backtesting, and deployment.

---

## Problem
Manual traders face barriers to automation:  
- Coding complexity  
- Lack of trust in algorithms  
- Complexity of existing platforms  

Goal: provide an **easy, visual, trustworthy path** to algo trading.

## Competitor Insights
| Platform | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| QuantConnect | Cloud backtesting, multi-language | Steep learning curve |
| AlgoTrader | Full lifecycle, broker integration | Expensive, complex |
| TradingView | Easy scripting, community scripts | Limited backtesting |
| Streak (India) | Drag-drop, retail-friendly | Limited customization |
| Backtrader / Zipline | Flexible, open-source | Requires coding/setup |

**Gap:** Retail-friendly semi-automation that simplifies manual → algo trading.

## Proposed Feature
- Replay past trades  
- Auto-generate trading rules  
- Visual block/flow editor to refine logic  
- Backtest & simulate  
- Paper/live deployment

## Wireframe Concept
1. **Replay Setup:** Select trades/date, Start Replay  
2. **Replay View:** Chart + trade markers, inferred logic panel  
3. **Strategy Editor:** Block-based logic, parameters, Backtest/Simulate  
4. **Backtest Results:** Equity curve, metrics, Deploy/Paper Trade  
5. **Monitoring:** Actual vs expected, refinement suggestions  

**Figma Prompt:** Design the 5 screens above with minimal, Nubra-style UI; include placeholders, navigation, and helper hints.
